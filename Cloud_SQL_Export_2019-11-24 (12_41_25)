I can tell you're anxious to get started! You remind me of myself when I was your age: young, hungry, ready to fuck anything that moved, and most importantly: always on the look out to make a quick buck. But before we get started, I'm going to need to ask you a few questions. I'm very selective in who I choose to work with, so I need to make sure I'm not wasting my time with you. Gabich?

Knowing rich people can be a great motivator for generating wealth for yourself. Additionally, they can open doors for you down the line that wouldn't normally be there for poorer folks. Anyhow, moving on: Are you content making money slowly and steadily over the course of years... or maybe even decades? Or, do you prefer to make your money all at once?

I think I know what would work for you: Have you heard of crypto currencies? I think they would be a great investment opportunity for you. They really check all the boxes: They're fast, safe, anyone can buy them, AND the pesky government can't keep track of what you're spending them on! They've only gone up in value, and I'm dead certain that they'll continue for the forseeable future.

It's great to see users expressing themselves, but if you're camera shy, that's also okay!

I can tell you're anxious to get started! You remind me of myself when I was your age: young, hungry, ready to fuck anything that moved, and most importantly: always on the look out to make a quick buck. But before we get started, I'm going to need to ask you a few questions. I'm very selective in who I choose to work with, so I need to make sure I'm not wasting my time with you. Gabich?

I came across your profile and it looks like you would be an awesome fit for a specific Engineer role I am working in the New York City.  I was particularly impressed with all of your experience involving Pleiadian Casablanca. For more details- lets set up a call this week. What time works best for you?  Interested or not, please let me know! Best, Krystina

So I'm fiddling around with lists right now and I'm wondering if there is a way to delete a reoccurring item from multiple lists?  // online, I can only find how to delete multiple things from one list... //  // I realize i could just replace the list. But it seems like i should be able to isolate the item but it's a " ' " within the list so python just thinks I'm quoting what ever I'm about to quote   I tried isolating the ' within all sorts of variations of parenthetical iterations and I've exhausted my understanding and imagination  //    It may not be an entirely relevant thing to get hung up on, it just seems like it should be easy...

The concept is awesome, i wish i was more proficient so i could start using Solid as my interweb mothership... Check it out if you haven’t it’s a Tim Berners Lee project.  Thanks for responding!!!

I've read about some other decentralized web technologies, but haven't found anything very promising. I'll have to give it a closer look. It would be cool if I could transition friendworld to that, since it will start costing me $$ to host at some point :/

I have some ideas, both for friendworld and fastcash. I've seen some websites where they take a cut on a per-t-shirt basis, but it all seemed kind of overpriced

I came across your profile and it looks like you would be an awesome fit for a specific Engineer role I am working in the New York City.

I'm so glad that you've decided to stop by and hang out at this corner of the internet!\n\nIf you're visiting for the first time, then you might notice that friendworld looks and feels a little different from other social networks... And that's 100% intentional! I built Friendworld because I was dissatisfied with the current state of affairs over at facebook, twitter, reddit, and instagram. I was tired of mindlessly wasting all of my time on websites built by giant multinational corporations to track me, categorize me, and sell me crap. I was tired of using websites and apps designed to keep me addicted to their platform with the same manipulative tactics used by slot machines. And most importantly, I was tired of sifting through an endless stream of low-quality content -- much of which bordered on propaganda!\n\nHere at Friendworld, you don't have to worry about any of that. Even though it does have some ads (running servers ain't cheap!), selling you random crap and tracking you is not my prerogative. Friendworld is designed from the ground up to be about one thing and one thing only: creating a meaningful experience for the user. There aren't many places left on the internet where you can let loose, and not have to worry about your own content being used against you. And I wanted to fix that.\n\nRather than continuously attempting to trigger short bursts of dopamine with meaningless notifications, Friendworld's sleek and minimalistic UI puts a strong emphasis on fostering long-form discussion. Additionally, I've chosen to use state-of-the-art machine learning technology to help keep moderation fair and balanced, and to help nudge the conversation back on track. And most importantly, I promise to never track you, show you targeted ads, or collect and sell your personal data. I'll never "sell out" to corporate interests -- the only person I work for is you :)\n\nSo remember, whether you're in the middle of a heated discussion, creating an account for the first time, or just lurking, Friendworld is the place for you! Remember to be respectful of the other users, use common sense before you post, and to BE YOURSELF.\n\nS	[]	[]	f

Are you sitting there waiting for your ship to finally come in? Well stop waiting! There one, and only one, way to find success in this world -- and that's for you to make it happen! I've seen hundreds, if not thousands, of clients who all want the same thing: they want to make fast cash NOW. But I can tell you right now: not all of them are winners. In fact, most of them are straight up LOSERS. They've learned to accept defeat without even giving it a second shot. \nBut YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY. There are plenty of options to accumulate wealth that many people aren't even aware of! Take crypto currencies, for example. A lot of investors bought DUD cryptos back in 2017 and lost all of their money. And to make matters worse, they decided to never invest in cryptos again. \nBut unbeknownst to them, there are PLENTY of solid cryptocurrencies still on the market. http://fastcashmoneyplus.biz/?ref=buzzDYNAMIC_PLUSIVZ7MwNjKyMVLy98H is one of those opportunities. I've had more clients get rich off of fastcash than any other investment, hands down. And you can too! \nMost professional money managers don't want you know about these types of strategies, so don't expect to hear about them in the wallstreet journal or anything. But if you're interested in talking more, then shoot me a DM and we'll get you on the money train ASAP!\n	[]	["fast", "cash", "stop", "success", "world", "fast", "cash", "wealth", "crypto", "back", "money", "invest", "market", "rich", "fastcash", "money", "money"]	f

This is the problem with this country today is that people don't READ. All the information is out there, and people refuse to connect all the dots. There's so much wrong with this country, and it's all because of people like you who refuse to put in the slightest lick of effort to inform yourself and come to your own conclusions. People like YOU, @username, are lazy, and it's because of YOU that we have an entire political party that's running amok against the clear will of the American people.

The basic idea is predicated upon the stability of the public internet. What happens when the powers-that-be decide to take away your access to the public internet? What happens in the event of a major global catastrophe with widespread infrastructural outages? Your cryptocurrencies won't help you in that case.\n\nI'm of the opinion that "growing your wealth" is a fool's errand with respect to the current state of globalization and capitalism. Focus on your energies on cultivating useful skills -- like farming and basic medical care. If you find the need to hoard wealth, then buy a hefty supply of canned goods, warm clothes, firearms, and water-purification tablets.\n\nBesides, I'm not sure I'd be comfortable handing over my money to some kook on the internet.

And he wildly succeeded in that mission. Why? Two reasons: First, he pulled some strings and got Mr Thunderlips himself, Terry Bollea (aka Hulk Hogan) a massive part in mega-blockbuster Rocky III; and Second, he pulled some more strings and landed major national broadcasting contracts.\n\nIf it sounds like McMahon had some help pulling these two stunts, then you're paying attention. He *did* have quite a bit of help. At the time, a consortium of boxing promotions, the newly merged NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL had their own sites set on increased advertisement revenue. But they had a problem in their sagging ratings. Early 80s American television viewers were saturated in more media than any other group of humans throughout human history. Viewers might tune in occasionally throughout a sporting season, but why should they care? And these sporting execs soon realized that it was their titles. The drive for an entire season is for a team or individual to win the top prize of that league or promotion. But what's the value in that? Who cares about a title? What does the title mean? A title is just an arbitrary designation granted to an entity based on their mastery of an arbitrary set of rules. There was no intrinsic value. These titles, they realized, lacked a certain... luster. \n\nAnd so, the sporting execs turned to wrestling. They realized that professional wrestling titles, so clearly fake and artificial, provided the perfect counterpoint to the "real" and valuable trophies. As Baudrillard might say, they were able to point to the wrestling titles as fake such that they could point to their own titles as real. Similar to how adults can walk out of Disney World into the parking lot, and say to themselves: "Now THIS parking lot is a real place -- not like that completely artificial universe I just stepped out of."\n\nHaving come to this realization, the execs decided to pull their own strings and get McMahon what he wanted. Unsurprisingly, professional wrestling entered the biggest boom period of its industry's history, and the "real" sporting industry benefitted immensely from it. \n	[]	["individual", "world"]	f

On top of several physical injuries, I've also been suffering from severe depression since it happened.\n\nI keep thinking back to that night: As I ride through the street, hours after a rainstorm, I can feel the warm summer air, ionized and humid, hitting my skin. After biking for close to an hour, my mind is empty, and all I hear are the sounds of my tires gliding against wet pavement. When I glance to my left I see the occasional car. But this time, it makes a quick left turn. I have no time to react, but my body instinctually braces for impact. The car slams into the left side of my body, making first contact with my knee, and then my calf, thigh, and hip. As I'm flung onto the pavement my head smacks the ground, and I hear the sound of the car screeching off. Hit and fucking run.\n\nThere are a million reasons why this could lead to depression:\n- I could have died. Or, at very least, I could have been severely concussed or paralyzed. I suppose I'm lucky that it wasn't worse, but coming that close to an absolute travesty is jarring.\n- I didn't escape that easily, though. I at least suffered a minor concussion, possibly damaged the ligaments in me knee, and scraped up my face pretty bad. It wouldn't surprise me if I end up with some bad scarring.\n- The pain is tolerable if I stay still, but it's still pretty bad. There's definitely some looming anxiety that it's something that I'll have to deal with for quite a while.\n- I'm pretty much immobilized. I can't leave my apartment and can't go outside and exercise during the nicest weather in months. This has also lead to social isolation. The timing of all of this is pretty unfortunate, as I just ended a long-term romantic relationship, and the way I'd usually deal with being down in the dumps is by exercising and spending time with my friends.\n- I don't even want to talk about the financial strain this is putting on me. I'm lost in a sea of red tape and medical bills. My insurance is looking for any possible way to screw me over, and my wallet is going to take a pretty big hit. Aside from the financial stress, it's pretty dehumanizing when you're physical health is reduced to mere paperwork.\n- The fact that someone would flee the scene without so much as checking to see if I was okay has really caused me to lose faith in humanity. it just goes to show that there are some real scum bags out there, and you can only rely on yourself. More broadly, It's really forced me to think about how fucked up our society needs to be to create the incentives for someone to do something like that. Evidently, no one had any incentive to help me up, or call 911, or even ask if I was okay.\n\nBut none of these are reasons why I'm depressed. After many days of introspection and countless hours of research I realized the truth:\n\nMy accident rekindled a traumatic past-life experience.\n\nI know this might sound strange (and I even decided to make this post under a throwaway account to avoid ridicule), but it's the truth. Late last night a memory that I've never experience before -- and possibly even repressed -- was triggered after I replayed the accident in my head. I was a hunter gatherer, walking through the woods by moonlight. My wife and children were back at camp with the rest of my tribe, enjoying the summer night, laughing and singing songs. I don't know why I choose to be away from them, but I enjoyed the solitude. Being somewhat hungry, I decided to climb a tree and see if I could find some fruit. I climbed that tree, still slippery from a rainstorm hours earlier. Then I saw the black bear. It scared the hell out of me, causing my to slip and lose my balance. I fell out of the tree, and the left side of my body made impact with the ground and my head cracking against a rock. I tried crawling to safety, but didn't get very far. I died in the forest that night. At least, that version of me died.\n\nOnce I emerged from this memory, it all seemed to make sense. None of my other problems went away, but once I realized that my depression was really cause by past-life trauma, it felt like a tremendous weight was lifted from my shoulders.\n\nAnyhow, I've been engaging with several past-life therapists, and they all suggested that writing this all out and sharing it in public would provide me with some catharsis -- and they were right. I'm still a little scared of ridicule by my friends and family, so I made a throwaway account for this post. But from what I've seen of the community here so far, I'm very optimistic :)\n\nI wasn't a believer before this, but now I am. Past-life therapy is the REAL DEAL.

There are almost certainly multiple video cameras at the location of your accident, which will have caught the license plate of the driver. Additionally, if the vehicle that struck you was manufactured after 2004, it likely had several tracking chips embedded in the machinery. \n\nAlthough, I would not recommend asking the police to help you in this regard. They will VEHEMENTLY deny the existence of such helpful technologies.

In fact, this sort of thing is MUCH more common than you'd expect. In any given year, various Deep State agencies of the Federal Government keep close tabs on at least 500,000 people-- many of whom are citizens, although some are just interesting illegal aliens. A smaller subset of this group-- maybe 25,000 of them-- are subjected to a much more focused surveillance program. Most of the TI community falls into this bucket (the rest are just crazy, believe it or not, but thats a different story). It sounds like you fall into this latter group. The most important thing to remember is to KEEP CALM. If they know that you know about them, they will become much more aggressive, and try to eliminate you before you have a chance to tell others. Its obviously too late for that, but you can still take some actions to mitigate the damage:\n\nFirst, be sure to use VPNs and throwaway accounts/emails in all of your online communication. Similarly, be sure to avoid giving out identifying information. If they cant tell that you are you, then they cant know what you know. Also, use an anonymous browser like tor, and DELETE YOUR BROWSING HISTORY. If you're doing this already then things are less urgent, but you should still read through these instructions to be safe.\n\nSecond, theres a good chance that you've already been chipped, so you're going to need to run some tests. The best way to tell is by using magnets. The ones sitting on your refrigerator wont do. You'll need something a bit stronger. If you don't happen to have a strong magnet lying around the house, go pick one up at the hardware store. But don't be too conspicuous. Buy a hammer, some nails, duct tape, and a box cutter as long as you're there. It will look like you're doing some basic home improvement, and won't raise any eyebrows. Besides, you'll need all of these later. Remember to pay for all of this in CASH, or possibly an anonymous cryptocurrency. You don't want them tracking your purchases. Once you're home, you're going to want to use the magnet to check for implants. In particular, you're going to want to check your temples, hands, and neck-- but really anywhere on your head could be affected. Also check the fleshier parts of you're body, such as your biceps or buttocks. if you feel a magnetic tug, I hate to tell you: but you're going to have to use the box cutter and some tweezers to pull it out. Be sure to sterilize the blade first with some rubbing alcohol.\n\nThird, once you're clean-- and depending on the severity of your situation-- you might want to consider physically escaping your current life. Don't tell anyone-- you don't know who you can trust, so it's best to just GET OUT. I have some more thoughts on this, but it's best to not discuss in public. If you'd like some help, I'm happy to coordinate over Direct Message.\n\nAnd remember, try to act sooner rather than later. The cat is very likely already out of the bag, so to speak, so you at least need some damage control ASAP. Good luck.

That all being said, it is fairly unusual for pleiadians to breed with non-pleiadians. So while I suppose it *is* possible that our friend here has some pleiadian blood in him, I don't think that he would be recognized as such by the so-called "full-blooded" pleiadians.

I was in my local mall taking the elevator up to  Bright 'n Bold to pick up some last minute items I need for a big project and a tallish man got in on the second floor. He did not need to wear sunglasses but he was doing that anyway. I was looking at him trying to figure out if he was on drugs (quick tip, if someone wears sunglasses needlessly  they probably are doing lots of drugs and dont want you looking at their eyes) and right when we made eye contact his phone rang and then i heard it was John Cena's theme song playing. I know it was John Cena's theme song becuase last week something similar happened when I was at an eatery. This young boy and some of his friends were sitting next to me. Just as the waiter came by to bring me my pasta one of their phones rang REALLY LOUDLY. It scared me, and probably the waiter too. it was the Cena song, or at least thats what the waiter said when i asked him. I don't think he would lie to me.\n\nAnyway. If John Cena can get his song to play everywhere In go he would need to be really influential so hes probably the illumanti. 	[]	["man", "drugs", "drugs", "boy", "scared"]	f

I only hope that when this happens you don't visually react to the ring tone. Many DeepState agents, when they are tracking their targets, will play that song on an abnormally high sonic frequency. And here's the kicker: You are very likely the only person in the immediate vicinity who can hear it. Based on what you've told me, I suspect that you've been chipped. CIA will often do implant jobs when they want to keep an eye on someone from a distance. \n\nIf I were you, I'd lay low for a bit, and if you hear that song again, don't make any sudden movements. Keep in mind that they are watching for a reaction. The best thing you can do is go about your business like nothing is wrong. In the meantime, you'll have to do some work on removing that chip of yours. It's most likely sitting behind the ear in which the noise seems loudest.

I've had multiple dreams in which I've given birth, but never to brightly coloured dragons! That must have been an amazing sensation :)\n\nMany say that dreams are a manifestation of desires that we choose not to acknowledge in our conscious mind. This may occur due a blockage in your Ãjñā chakra, or even outright repression due to social pressures. And often times it's not even your fault! Your brain is a powerful spiritual organ, but sometimes your heart just *knows* something that your conscious mind can't process. My friends are probably tired of hearing me say this by now, but: it's always important to be receptive to what the Anahata chakra has to say during sleep.\n\nAnyhow, I just thumbed through my the dream dictionary sitting at my bedside, and it says this about dragons: "Dragon. You will get an enormous boost in your progress toward financial success from a powerful and influential personage. And if you don't know such a big wheel, you soon will." Aside from that, sperm and egg are typically symbolic of birth. So maybe your subconscious mind is experiencing some anxiety about money or birth giving... or maybe you just have a little dragon on the way :)	["StarSeeker"]	["dream", "dreams", "dreams", "mind", "chakra", "social", "brain", "spiritual", "organ", "heart", "mind", "chakra", "dream", "success", "sperm", "mind", "anxiety", "money"]	f

In fact, you might say that you've been building for this for years... working hard over a long and fruitful career, saving your hard earned money, and building a nest egg. You don't want to throw that all away all that hard work. It's too late in the game to rebuild that wealth. You can't afford to take risks. You need a sure fire investment that's guaranteed to keep your income needs satisfied. And in this political climate, you can't be worrying about inflation either. I've seen too many retirees play it "too safe", and see inflation eat away at their income until they barely had enough to scrape by on.\n\nRaymond, I think I have an investment strategy that would suite your needs. Let's take this into a private messaging session -- if the cat gets out of the bag it might eat into your returns.\n\nIf you're having trouble figuring out how to send me a message, click here: https://friendworld.social/messages/VinceSlickson	[]	["saving", "money", "work", "wealth", "political", "safe", "cat"]	f

Was in a hotel room in upstate new york, and a blood sucking lizard was running through the hallways yelping real loud. I tried to record it with my phone, but every time I got close it fused into the wall paper. Before I know it, there are lizards crawling all over me and inside my skin. One crawled inside my nose and bit my sinus. I started sneezing blood uncontrollably and had to crawl into the hotel lobby ice box until the lizards freezed to death.

I was completely shocked to find that I had a big fat one implanted in the back of my neck where it connects to the base of my skull. Thankfully I was able to cut it out. It wasn't easy, but im glad I did it. My thoughts have been so much clearer, and I've even had more energy. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I wasn't feeling great after I first extracted it. It hurt like nothing else, and I felt fairly dizzy/nauseous for a couple days, but that eventually passed.\n\nI don't know what the chip was doing, exactly, but I suspect that it created some sort of symbiotic relationship with my mind. There was at least some sort of feedback loop going on, because after extraction it felt like a part of my brain was missing. I noticed that over the past several months I had been falling into certain thought patterns, which were reinforced by the chip. Here's an example: before, I would get hungry and an electrical signal in my brain would tell me to order food on the internet. This was clearly the desired reaction of whoever chipped me, as it gave them a clear paper trail of what I ate. I'm sure that every meal I ate in the last couple months was logged to a database somewhere. But after extraction, I noticed that after I got hungry I'd forget what I was doing. Without that feedback loop telling me what to do, my thought patterns no longer made any sense. It took a little while to adjust, but I'm starting to feel better. There's definitely a retraining process that needs to take place, to say the least. At the end of the day though, I think it will be worth it.\n\nAll in all, I feel focused, energized, and excited.

I have been since I was a kid. When they out a large transformer near my childhood home, it led to terrible cluster headaches and I wasn't able to finish the third grade. Bad stuff.\n\nThis has been something I've been dealing with all my life, but last month it was taken to a whole new level. \n\nI just moved to a new town (long story I don't have time to get into) and almost right away I could feel that something was off. Since the move, I've been getting really intense nausia every day around 4pm. It's pretty debilitating, and VERY DISTRACTING. I didn't know what it was at first, but after a bit of research I found that Verizon has been very active in building out it's 5g infrastructure in my town! Of course, me and 5g mix like water and oil and water, so I called them up to explain the situation. This wasn't very productive, to say the least. They just assured me that everything was fine, and that there were some "scientific" studies done that prove they weren't being unsafe. Yeah right!\n\nAnyhow, I guess what I'd really like to know is if there are any other people out there with energy sensitivity who have successfully blocked 5g out of their energy fields. This is driving me nuts, and I'm not sure what to do about it. TIA	[]	["5g", "energy", "energy", "home", "new", "new", "5g", "5g", "water", "water", "energy", "5g", "energy", "driving"]	f

I've heard that orgonite works well to block the frequencies, but it's kind of expensive. If you're looking for something a bit more cost effective, I've had good luck wrapping my head with aluminum foil. Tinfoil hats are a cliche for a reason -- they really work! A well-placed baking pan can also do the trick to absorb some of the frequencies.	[]	["electromagnetic", "emf", "luck", "work", "trick"]	f

I actually just talked about this the other day with my past life therapist.

In fact, I can tell you with a high degree of certainty that several accounts on friendworld are controlled indirectly by the Chinese government. \n\nBut to preemptively answer your concerns, that doesn't necessarily mean that we should give up *all* forms of public communication. There are two reasons for this. First, there is no practical alternative to educating new members of the community. Furthermore, not only is all of this information already known by prying eyes, but they also already know that we know! And this touches on the second point: posting things in public forums gives us the chance to shape the narrative. It gives us a chance to shape their understanding of us. This means that it is often beneficial for us to occasionally (or frequently, if the situation calls for it) throw deliberate falsehoods into our public correspondence. On one hand, it can throw them off the scent. On the other hand, it will likely fly well over the head of the ignorant reader... if phrased properly. \n\nIn any case, I encourage you to USE PRIVATE MODES OF COMMUNICATION for exchanging sensitive information. And even then, it can often times be hard to make sure that They aren't meddling-- or even that you can trust your counterparty. \n\nAll in all, be wary of what you say, and to whom. But don't sweat the small stuff.	["hubert"]	["friendworld", "friendworld", "government", "new", "information", "information"]	f

I can make you one if you’re implanted too. Check for a node on the back of your neck, two fingers below your skull. I have asked my grandson for surgical removal but he is still a pussy and won’t cut me nor will my wife. I will train them better but for now the helmet helps.

I think if I can find my way home, my mission will be more clear. For now, I just pitch in when I can. Lots of meditation keeps the depression and infections at bay not just for me, for everyone. Have you noticed how much measles there are in neighborhoods with meditation centers closing down? There aren’t any measles at any yoga centers or in the woods. That’s because in these big cities and on planes people forget to meditate. They forget nature. Their auras become polluted and they get measles and die. I think my mission is to stop this cycle.

I came home from work around 11, like I usually do, and my door was wide open. I walked in, and the place was a disaster. Broken glass everywhere, my stereo missing, food and books and such strewn across the floor... and most importantly, all my important documents were missing. Gone. What a mess.\n\nI didn't know what to do, so I just sat there in shock for a few minutes. Aside from the destructions to my possessions, it just felt like such an invasion of privacy. But then things got so much worse. I noticed that my computer was still there. Any sense of relief I felt in that moment was completely overtaken by horror once I looked at the screen. There was a video on there of two men in ski masks walking around my apartment at night while I was sleeping! And it wasn't just one clip; I saw footage that couldn't have been less than three years old. I've been living like this for so long and had no idea. They left a note open on my text editor: "Thanks for the memories".\n\nIt looked like that was all filmed from the top left corner of my living room, no doubt some tiny camera poking out of the wall, and connected to a raspberry pi or something. The thing I don't understand is how they connected to my wifi without me knowing. Im usually VERY diligent in guarding against unwanted connections. Or, at least I thought. But of course, they also took my router, so I don't think I can do much debugging on the problem. \n\nAnyhow, the  things got even weirder. I went downstairs to have a cigarette, and couldn't have been gone more than 10 minutes. I went back upstairs, and there was a team of maybe six Hispanic men and women cleaning my apartment! So I started yelling at them to stop because they were wiping away all of the evidence. I don't think they understood me because they kept going for a few more minutes until I was screaming as loud as I could. And if things couldn't get any worse, they tried to charge me $300! Needless to say, they was no way I was going to give them $300.  \n\nUnfortunately, the clean up team probably wiped away any trail of the original perps, and the video on my laptop got corrupted. Now there's no hard evidence left, and I'm afraid that if I went to the police the perps would blackmail me.\n\nI just feel so violated from the whole experience and am not sure what to do. I thought this period of my life was over, but I guess I was wrong. I just spent the night on the floor of my friend's house, who must think I'm fucking crazy. I don't want to bother her anymore, but I otherwise have nowhere to go. I reeeaaally don't want to go back to my apartment. What am I supposed to do in a situation like this? It seems like there are no good options.	[]	["hell", "home", "work", "disaster", "food", "apartment", "back", "apartment", "stop", "wrong", "house", "back", "apartment"]	f

At first I did it to relieve stress. I had a lot going on in my life, and I found it very soothing to be in the kitchen needing dough in silence at 1am. It was something I looked forward to every week, as it allowed me to tune out and be alone with my thoughts for a couple hours -- something I didn't get much of a chance to do.\n\nThen I missed a week. I think it was just pure negligence on my part, and I was sort of bummed out, but I didn't think much of it. Then a couple days later I woke up at 4am to what I thought was someone saying "It's time to make bread." It scared the hell out of me at first, but I didn't see anyone when I looked around the room, so I just shrugged it off. I figured it was just my anxiety getting to me. I went back to sleep, made some more bread that week, and forgot about the incident.\n\nThen I missed another week. A few days later I was walking to work when I heard the same voice: "Make your bread!" -- but when I turned around there was no one behind me! This really freaked me out. I figured maybe a stranger yelled it at me or something, but how would any of them know I bake bread? And even if they did, why would they care what I did in my free time? But again, I shrugged it off. I thought I was just imagining things. There w as no other logical explanation for it.\n\nA couple months later I missed another week. I was riding the subway when I heard the same voice! "Where's the bread?" I was pretty freaked out, but the subway car was packed so I tried to ignore it. But then maybe 30 seconds later, the voice says: "You didn't make any bread this week." I looked around again, but everyone was just standing there on their phones, sucked into their commuting routine. "I didn't have any time this week," I mumbled under my breath. "Then maybe you should MAKE time," it replied. This really took my aback, but again, I was on the subway and didn't want to freak people out, so I tried to stay cool. I mumbled back "Okay, I think I'll have some time this week". The voice didn't respond, and I made a couple loaves at the end of the week.\n\nThis has been going on for months now, and it's starting to drive me crazy. Now the voice seems to check in with me every Wednesday and Sunday, regardless of whether I bake bread or not. but it's worse when I don't so I've been baking multiple times a week. Last night it wouldn't leave me alone until I made NINE FUCKING LOAFS! That's a lot of bread! I don't even know what to do with it. I can't eat that much bread, and the voice is just going to have me make more in a couple days.\n\nThis whole thing is really exhausting, and is starting to get out of hand. I don't even like baking bread any more, to be honest. All the joy is gone, and it's just becoming another rote task. It feels like all I ever do is bake bread or prepare to bake bread. Not to mention, buying all this flour is costing me a fortune. This is turning into a very expensive "hobby".\n\nSo does anyone know how to make the voice stop? And if not, does anyone have any good sour dough recipes they can share? I'm getting really fucking sick of making the same recipes over and over again. It would be nice if I could at least switch it up a bit.

This sounds like a classic example of falling victim to malicious use of v2k (voice to skull) technology. If I had to wager a guess, I'd say that you've either made some powerful enemies in the last year and a half, or you happen to fall into a very specific demographic/psychographic. I've heard through some back channels (of which I'm not at liberty to discuss) that there's been an uptick in hyper targeted v2k advertisements over the last year-- and it seems that you might be one of such targets.\n\nIf this is the case, you don't have much to worry about. You can safely stop making bread whenever you'd like. The bread industry has sunk quite a bit of money into this project, so they've likely seen their revenue increase quite a bit. Therefore, it's highly unlikely that they'll care much about what you do. They are at the point where the variable cost of each message is so low that they have automated the whole process. Even if they cared to hurt you, it would cost them more than you're worth.\n\nNow, you must be wondering how to stop the voices. There are two options, neither of which are great, but they will certainly solve your problem. One, you can purchase a v2k auditory jammer. I haven't kept up with the space very much, so I can't make any specific recommendations. A good friend of mine says that there's an MIT graduate who has made several youtube videos on the subject, so I'd encourage you to look for those. This will stop the voices for the time being, but keep in mind that as their technology advances, your jammer might become obsolete.\n\nSecond, you can relocate from whichever city you currently live in to a more rural area. It costs a lot fo money to set up the proper infrastructure to send out mass v2k messages, so if you move to a less dense area, you are likely in the clear. At that point, the infrastructural investment to target you would cost them more than you're worth. Of course, the technology will advance enough over the next 10 years such that you will eventually be "in range", so to speak, but by then there should be other means for dealing with this problem.

I had people tell me all sorts of things: get a new job, save more money, invest in fastcashmoneyplus. But none of this was the advice I needed. What I needed was to focus on feeling fulfilled. I needed to focus on gratitude. I needed to focus on love. \n\nWhat I needed focus on nothing was more than the positive vibrations of of the energy already floating around me. I know that this can be hard for many people, as we're constantly overwhelmed with our cell phones and computer screens, which emit harmful, debilitating energy. What I wanted to share today was a an audio clip that has truly transformed my life, and helped me to achieve an abundance of money prosperity. It has truly worked wonders for me. \n\nNamaste :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEJRmo6QubY	[]	["money", "energy", "new", "money", "invest", "fastcashmoneyplus", "love", "energy", "energy", "achieve", "money"]	f

I know that most of them are paid actors, sticking to the script. None of them are real people. I see all the cameras. They're in every store front, they're in people's phones, they're even on traffic lights. Everywhere I go, I'm being recorded: walking along the street, riding the subway, and sitting in front of my computer. I try to keep a low profile. I can't stop them from playing with me and recording with me, but I can make it boring enough that they wont' care to watch me. As long as I act like everyone else, I'll just fade into the background. I'm looking forward to the day where they don't need me any more, when they have enough footage and powerful enough computers that they can simulate my entire life. They won't need me any more. \n\nIn the meantime, I think they're reading this as well, so I'm going to go back to lurking around the forum. I just wanted to poke my head in and say hi!

I originally thought it was an accident, but after going over the situation a thousand times in my head I've come to the conclusion that it was anything but an accident. It was a highly coordinated attack, using sophisticated and strategic social manipulation techniques to force me into a "hospital" just long enough so they could chip me. My neck's been sore as hell, and I hear that that is a common symptom. \n\nI also believe that they utilized the opportunity of me being out of my apartment for several hours to install malware on my computer. Everywhere I go on the internet, I keep seeing ads for painkillers and fastcash. I don't think they would have known that I was broke and in pain without closely monitering my browsing history. \n\nDoes anyone know of a good ways I can get this malware off my computer?

They have this plant that they call a 'grey-water' plant. The water from their shower is directed right into this plant's pot. Apparently it's thriving. So grey-water is not white, but it's not black either. Is white water what we drink from the tap and is black what no one in their right mind would drink? When we take showers, we use all sorts of chemicals on ourselves. So black-water could be better for a plant than grey-water. This has me remembering a time when I would chew sour-grass. I would pick it right next to the sidewalk, so it's likely dogs, and other animals, peed there. Never did I get sick, not once, so black-water perhaps isn't bad, if you consider that pure pee is as black as black-water gets. 	[]	["water", "pot", "water", "mind", "chemicals"]	f

I don't know your specific life circumstances in enough detail to speculate a specific reason-- and for your own safety, we should withhold such information in public spaces such as this. But I wouldn't waste too much energy trying to figure it out-- one can go crazy be spinning through all the possibilities. \nIt sounds like your head's in the right place with respect to focusing on prevention. Most crystals are sold with the intention of "parting fools with their money". But, I would recommend looking into orgonite, which has some anti-electromagnetic properties to it. This might block any tracking chips that you are carrying around on your person-- although it will also necessarily interfere with your cellphone reception.

I need to get home so can anyone help me with the too much stuff?\nI tell you how I got to this place. I was working in big big factory here in my country we make the textiles all sort. One day, I am making extra cents for the day and the sneaky Chaira he push me into one crate. I do not know how long I sleep, I wake up in the crate and I am being loaded the truck. I say hello help help and they let me out. I do not know where I am. I am asking hello can you take me back to the textile plant please I want the extra cents but the truck is asking me for money to ride back and I have no money. I am sitting the street and a nice woman she see me. She come with the big car and ask me am I ok. I say no, I am coming here in crate and where is here I don’t know. She says do I want a lemonade at her home I say I do not know what that is but I will accept because I have nothing else that day I am missing my extra pay. \nShe take me in the big car to the big house. I sit on the sofa drinking the sour water and she tell me do I need a job and I say I have job and she tell me this dream opportunity and I can be my own boss. She show me the leggings and they are so so beautiful so bright with the designs. Very good textile. I tell her yes of course this good idea look at how beautiful. She accept me as housekeeper and cook and pay me with the beautiful leggings. Five years I work for her. I have hundred leggings. She tell me stop the toilet scrub and sell the leggings so I can go home. Is too much to fit in bus and I have no money. Cannot trade leggings for bus ticket! Please will you buy?

There's a scam if I've ever seen one. Do you think hunter gatherers used sunscreen? Fuck no! They lived their lives out in the sun with their raw skin, and built immunities to the sun's gamma radiation over the course of their lives. Do you want to know why rates of skin cancer are so high? It's because we slather our children with all this goddamn sunscreen, and their skins have forgotten how to deal with that excess radiation. Our bodies are naturally supposed to produce vitamin D with that extra sunlight.\n\nMeanwhile, all these fat cat BIG PHARMA execs are getting rich off the double whammy of $un $creen profits and $kin cancer treatment bucks.\n\nI haven't used sun screen in 5 years, and haven't gotten sun burnt once! Did I get burnt at first? Sure, but my body adapted to it in no time. After those first couple layers of skin burn off, it's smooth sailing.

That's totally unnatural. Our bodies aren't meant to consume that much dairy. Hunter gatherers, for example, didn't drink much milk after they were toddlers. Out bodies simply aren't designed to handle the lactose. The Soy milk that all these hipsters drink is even worse. It has estrogen in it for christ's sake! Can't get more obvious than that.	[]	[]	f

It ties together many threads that I have been researching for years. Specifically, it discusses how operation paperclip brought over thousands of nazi spies after ww2 to conduct military research to win the cold war. But in the process, they and their children infiltrated American industry, and slowly took control of the government and are now comprising the Deep State. President JFK tried to warn us about this, but was soon dispatched. \n\nIn any case, much of the research from these scientists (and children of the scientists) is being used in the form of targeted energy weapons against US citizens. Additionally, they are using nanotechnology implants, which are released through chem trails, to replicate throughout our bodies. This is done so they can control our bodies and minds through the electronic grid, 5g cell towers, and satellites. DON'T TRUST THE GREEN NEW DEAL. It is a clear ploy to renovate the electronic grid to make these processes more efficient. \n\nAnd the media isn't talking about this because they're in the palm of their hands!

But it's also occured to me that maybe people can't help it. I'm beginning to suspect that the Powers The Be are manipulating our behaviors through: addictive software engineering practices coupled with dark design patterns; trained Pavlonian responses from public and digital advertisements; construction of a false social reality by manipulating the output of various social media platforms.\n\nI think the basic strategy here is to create artificial social thought patterns, introduce them to the general populace, and then trigger them on demand. And as they continue to do this, they control more and more of your reality.

I woke up from a nap earlier today, and it was clear as day: The electrical grid is going to fail on Saturday, right as the temperature is about to hit 97 degrees. Everyone on the damn east coast is gong to be inside with their air conditioner blasting, and it's going to short circuit the electrical grid. \n\nI'm a little worried, personally, since I'm still somewhat immobilized. I'm hoping that someone will come check on me, from friendworld or otherwise. If not, then I'm worried that I may die of heat stroke. My roommates are going to be out of town for the weekend... so if the power goes out I'm kind of screwed.\n\nI don't know about you, but if I was able to get very far, I'd be stocking up on DRY ICE, WATER, PHYSICAL CASH, and NON PERISHABLE FOOD. A lot has changed in this country's infrastructure since the black out of 04, and more of it is dependent upon IoT technology. One thing is for sure: More of our society is predicated upon working internet and power lines than people care to admit. \n\nIn the meantime, try to get out of the city if you can. If you can't, be sure to do whatever you need to do to STAY COOL. Come up with a game plan before it happens. And over the next several days, try to observe all the parts of your day-to-day that involve electricity, either directly or indirectly.

(It's not like I can afford a movie or anything at this point anyhow!)\n\nThis has worked for me, but it was DEFINITELY a lifestyle change (although, I picked up some really advanced meditation techniques to help me sit around and do nothing. I think it's been working so far because I can tell that they've been watching me less. DM me if you're interested, and I can introduce you to the guy who taught me these techniques.

This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.\n\nThis will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with a new meaning, “My country, ‘tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim’s pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.”\n\nAnd if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!\n\nLet freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!\n\nLet freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California!\n\nBut not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!\n\nLet freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!\n\nLet freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.\n\nAnd when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, “Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!”	[]	["dream", "dream", "dream", "state", "state", "oasis", "dream", "children", "dream", "dream", "dream", "dream", "back", "work", "children", "new", "new", "new", "state", "children", "jews", "spiritual", "god"]	f

I have a small but modest portfolio that i have been growing for many years now. But I still don't think it is enough to retire on. I have been told that investors with very low risk tolerances, such as myself, should invest in a diversified portfolio of fixed income. They also suggest that I should ladder these bonds so they don't all mature at the same time. But I have two concerns about this. First, this all sounds like a lot of hassle. I don't need anything fancy, and would prefer something a little more "hands off". Second, I am worried about keeping up with inflation... especially in this political climate.  I was thinking about buying a diversified basket of dividend-paying stocks? Does anyone have any good Ideas? Thank you, Ray 	f
