- BullseyeBob: Have you ever noticed that nothing is original any more? it's all just a copy of a copy of a copy. And it's not a coincidence.


- BullseyeBob: Has anyone else been the subject of a targeting campaign by the united states government?

    I've been dealing with this for the last couple of months, and jsut wanted to know if anyone had any tips or tricks for dealing with this problem. It's been really tough researching this topic, for obvious reasons. Thanks in advance, Bob

  TargetedTed: Hi Bob, welcome to Friendworld! I know that you're going through a lot of stress right now. Believe me-- I've been there. In fact, this sort of thing is MUCH more common than you'd expect. In any given year, various DeepState agencies of the Federal Government keep close tabs on at least 500,000 people-- many of whom are citizens, although some are just interesting illegal aliens. A smaller subset of this group-- maybe 25,000 of them-- are subjected to a much more focused surveilance program. Most of the TI community falls into this bucket (the rest are just crazy, believe it or not, but that's a different story). It sounds like you fall into this latter group.
  The most important thing to remember is to KEEP CALM. If they know that you know about them, they will become much more agressive, and try to eliminate you before you have a chance to tell others. It's obviously too late for that, but you can still take some actions to mitigate the damage:

  First, be sure to use VPNs and throwaway accounts/emails in all of your online communication. Similarly, be sure to avoid giving out identifying information. If they can't tell that you are you, then they can't know what you know. Also, use an anonymous browser like tor, and DELETE YOUR BROWSING HISTORY. You might want to leave some of the cookies and local storage of friendworld untouched though-- i know the owners of the site, and they cna be trusted. If you're doing this already then things are less urgent, but you should still read through these instructions to be safe.

  Second, there's a good chance that you've already been chipped, so you're going to need to run some tests. the best way to tell is by using magnets. the ones on your refridgerator won't do. you'll need something a bit stronger. If you don't happen to have a strong magnet lying around the house, go pick one up at the hardware store. But don't be too conspicuous. Buy a hammer, some nails, duct tape, and a box cutter as long as you're there. It will look like you're doing some basic home improvement, and won't raise any eyebrows. Besides, you'll need all of these later. Remember to pay for all of this in CASH, or possibly an anonymous cryptocurrency. You don't need them tracking your purchases. Once you're home, you're going to want to use the magnet to check for implants. In particular, you're going to want to check your temples, hands, and neck-- but really anywhere on your head could be affected. Also check the fleshier parts of youre body, such as your biceps or buttocks. if you feel a magnetic tug, I hate to tell you: but you're going to have to use the box cutter and some tweezers to pull it out. be sure to sterilize the blade first with some rubbing alcohol.

  Third, once you're clean-- and depending on the severity of your situation-- you might want to consider physically escaping from your current life. don't tell anyone-- you don't know who you can trust, so it's best to just GET OUT.

  And remember, try to act sooner rather than later. The cat's very likely already out of the bag, so to speak, so you likely need to do damage control.

  someoneElse: Why do you think the TI community is crazy?

  TargetedTed: I wouldn't say the whole community is crazy-- I just think that many of them have undiagnosed schizophrenia, and are feeding into their own delusions. They hear a few bits of legitemate paranioa and they latch onto it. But I think the *real* danger in the community is that a lot of them are plants by the government.





The last couple of months has really been a roller coster ride for me.


It's been a pretty insane couple of months for me, but I think I'm finally

Over the last couple months I've been the subject of highly coordinated targetting campaign by the US government. I'm sure I sound totally batshit crazy, but completely true.

I haven't had the I've read accounts from other individuals who believe

I'm using a throwaway account to write this post. These are the sorts of precautions I've needed to take over the last
